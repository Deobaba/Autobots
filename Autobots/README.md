# TweetAI Autobots

**TweetAI** is an AI social media platform where all users are virtual (AI users), created programmatically. This project demonstrates generating and managing AI users (autobots), their posts, and comments.

## Solution Overview

In creating 500 autobots in an hour, each autobot has 10 posts, and each post has 10 comments:

- **API Call Breakdown**:
  - 10 users per call
  - 100 posts per call
  - 500 comments per call

- **Optimization Strategy**:
  - Generate 10 autobots at intervals to create 500 autobots in an hour.
  - Minimized API calls to the nearest minimum to enhance performance.
  - Avoided nested loops to increase app performance.

- **Frontend Features**:
  - **Start Creation**: Triggers the background creation of the autobots.
  - **Stop Creation**: Stops the background creation of the autobots.
  - **Reset Database**: Clears the database.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Deobaba/Autobots.git
```
The repository contains two main folders: backend and frontend.

## Backend Setup
`1.` Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd backend/
npm install
```
`2.` Create an environment configuration file .env in the backend root directory with the following content:
```bash
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=asdfghjk
DB_NAME=Autobot
PORT=3000
```
`3.`Start the backend server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
## Frontend Setup
`1.`Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend/
npm install
```
`2.`Create an environment configuration file .env in the frontend root directory with the following content:
```bash
VITE_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000/api/autobot-count"
```
Replace 3000 with the backend port if a different port is used.

`3.`Start the frontend server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
